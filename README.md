MOTIVATION
Inspired by the coursework and the material covered, in the duration of this semester- 
we wanted to see if we could train a neural network model to write like some other legendary authors. 
Here for our experiments we used works by the legendary Nobel prize winner Rabindranath Tagore a giant in Bangla literature.
We wanted to explore the ideas and techniques covered in the course by experimenting and playing around with other prose styles and works,
to see what we could learn about these algorithms.
Our model is based on LONG-SHORT-TERM-MEMORY networks a sub-genre of Recurrent Neural Networks.
